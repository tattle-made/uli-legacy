# Introduction

This repository contains code for scraping publicly available data from targeted user accounts on Instagram https://instagram.com/

# Why are we scraping this data

For the project on detecting and responding to online gender based violence, we are collecting data from Instagram that can be annotated and used for detection models. See more project details here:https://tattle.co.in/products/ogbv/

# Scraping methodology

Open source library [instagram-scraper](https://github.com/arc298/instagram-scraper) is used for scraping,later on the images and videos are uploaded to aws
s3 buckets and finally the post meta-data along with s3-url is uploaded to mongo-db

# Run locally

1. Fork the Repository
2. Install required Python Packages `pip install requirements.txt`
3. Set up an AWS S3 bucket to store the scraped content (images, videos, text) and a MongoDB to store the scraped metadata 
   (timestamps, likes, tags )
4. Create a .env file in the same folder and save your Instagram MongoDB collection and S3 access credentials in the .env file. These should be in the following format
  
  ```
  INSTAGRAM_DB_USERNAME   = <YOUR_MONGODB_USERNAME>
  INSTAGRAM_DB_PASSWORD   = <YOUR_MONGODB_PASSWORD>
  INSTAGRAM_DB_NAME       = <YOUR_MONGODB_NAME>
  INSTAGRAM_DB_COLLECTION = <YOUR_MONGODB_COLLECTION>

  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = <YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY>
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_ID = <YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
  AWS_BUCKET = <YOUR_AWS_BUCKET>
  AWS_USERNAME = <YOUR_AWS_USER_NAME>
  ```
 5.Run the scraper as : `python dev_instagramscraper.py -u <txt file containing users list> -m <max posts to scrape> `
